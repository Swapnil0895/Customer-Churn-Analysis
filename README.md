# 📉 Customer Churn Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis with Python

## 🧠 Overview
This project dives into customer churn behavior in the telecom sector using exploratory data analysis (EDA). The main objective is to understand why customers leave and what factors influence their decision, with the goal of helping telecom companies reduce churn and improve customer retention.

## 📂 Project Files
- `TCA.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with full analysis, visualizations, and interpretation.
- `Customer Churn.csv` – Cleaned dataset used in the analysis.
- `Teco Customer Churn Analysys.pdf` – Summary report with insights and recommendations.

## 🎯 Objective
To identify patterns and drivers of customer churn by analyzing:
- Contract types
- Payment methods
- Tenure
- Internet service types
- Demographic attributes (age, seniority)

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Key Findings
- **Contract Type**: Month-to-month contracts had a churn rate of **42%**, much higher than **11%** for yearly and **3%** for two-year contracts.
- **Payment Method**: Customers paying via **electronic check** had the highest churn rate at **45%**, compared to **15–18%** for other methods.
- **Tenure**: Customers with less than 1 year tenure churned at **50%**, while those with 3+ years churned at only **15%**.
- **Senior Citizens**: Churn rate was **41%** for customers aged 65+, compared to **26%** for younger users.
- **Internet Service**: Fiber optic users churned at **30%**, compared to **20%** for DSL users.

## 💡 Recommendations
- Promote long-term contracts with incentives to reduce churn.
- Encourage customers to move away from electronic checks toward more stable payment methods.
- Prioritize engagement during the **first year**, when churn risk is highest.
- Design targeted retention programs for **senior citizens**.
